        Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Sales Data

In this project, I carried out exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a sales dataset containing transaction records across four regions (North, South, East, and West) and multiple product categories. The main goal of the analysis was to uncover meaningful business insights such as the best-performing regions, the top-selling products, revenue distribution, and potential sales trends that could guide decision-making in pricing, marketing, and inventory management.

-Business Problem

The business team needed actionable answers to specific questions, including:

* Which region contributes the highest revenue?
* What products are generating the most sales?
* Are there any observable seasonal or time-based trends in sales?
* How does the price per unit influence the overall revenue?

By focusing on these questions, the analysis aimed to help management allocate resources more effectively and identify opportunities for growth.

   Methodology
1. Data Validation

I began by validating the dataset to ensure accuracy and reliability. During this step, I checked for missing values, but none were found. I also reviewed the data types and corrected them where necessary, particularly for the date and numerical columns. To maintain consistency, I standardized the labels for regions and product categories, which eliminated any issues of duplicate labels caused by inconsistent naming.

2. Feature Engineering

To make revenue analysis possible, I created a new feature called Revenue, which I calculated as:
Revenue = Units Sold * Price Per Unit.This allowed me to directly measure the monetary performance of products and regions.

3. Descriptive Statistics

I used summary statistics with data.describe() to get an overall understanding of the dataset. This helped me evaluate central tendencies, variability, and distribution of sales across regions and product categories.

4. Visual Analysis

Visualization was a key part of the analysis. I created:

-Bar charts to compare revenue contributions across regions and products.
-Line plots to track sales performance over time and identify any upward or downward trends.
-Boxplots to detect outliers in revenue and pricing.
-Heatmaps to visualize correlations between features like Units Sold, Unit Price, and Revenue.

5. Correlation Analysis

I calculated pairwise correlations using data.corr() and represented them with a heatmap. This helped me understand how different variables related to one anotherâ€”for instance, the relationship between unit price and units sold, and how both influenced total revenue.

6. Outlier Detection

By using boxplots, I identified extreme values in the dataset. Instead of removing them immediately, I flagged them and assessed whether they represented genuine business situations (like unusually large orders) or potential data entry errors. Only clearly erroneous points were considered for removal.

Skills Applied

Throughout the project, I applied several data analysis skills:Data cleaning and preprocessing to prepare the dataset,feature engineering to create additional insights from existing data,data visualization using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn,statistical exploration and correlation analysis to understand underlying relationships and business insight translation to convert technical findings into meaningful recommendations.

Results and Business Insights

From the analysis, I derived several insights:

-Top Region:The South region generated the highest revenue. This suggests that management should consider allocating more stock and marketing efforts to this region.
-Top Product:Tablets emerged as the most sold product, making it a prime candidate for promotional campaigns and prioritized inventory.
-Revenue Trends:Although the dataset had limited time-based data, patterns showed consistent regional and product performance, which opens opportunities for forecasting.

Recommendations

Based on these insights, I proposed the following recommendations for the business:
* Focus more resources on high-performing products and regions to maximize returns.
* Use product demand trends to guide restocking and avoid understocking top sellers.
* Experiment with pricing strategies, especially for premium products, to identify optimal price points that balance sales volume and revenue.

Next Steps

While the exploratory analysis provided valuable insights, further work can be done to deepen understanding and support decision-making:

* Develop predictive models to forecast future sales trends.
* Perform market segmentation if customer-level data becomes available.
* Create an interactive dashboard in tools such as Streamlit or Tableau to make the insights easily accessible to business teams.
* Include profitability analysis by incorporating cost data, which would allow better margin evaluation.
* Test pricing optimization by simulating the impact of different price points on revenue and sales volume.
